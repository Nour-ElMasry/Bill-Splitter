# Bill-Splitter

After a night out with my friend group, we spent a long time figuring out how much each person had to pay. My friend and I decided to compete to see who could create the best bill splitter app. We were both eager to put our programming skills to the test and see who could come up with the most efficient and user-friendly solution.
